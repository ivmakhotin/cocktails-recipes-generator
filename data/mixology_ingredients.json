H\u00e9mard went into partnership with Veil Picard after the absinthe ban in 1915 and later merged with acquired Pernod. It seems in reality this was an anis-flavored wine aperitif, and that the \"violet color\" is a misattribution meant for Parfait Amour.

How this might relate to the flavorless, red, wadded-up thing stuffed in some cocktail olives, we would be hard-put to explain. The only currently produced brand appears to be Wray  Nephew Pimento Liqueur. Unfortunately, importation and marketing of this product ceased in the United States in the 1980s. Highly recommended.",

Sambucca is similar to Anisette but with a higher alcohol content. The term Sambuca usually refers to the transparent version, although other versions exist such as black sambuca. The liqueur is prepared by the steam distillation of star aniseeds. The resulting fragrant essential oil is infused with neutral spirits, witch elder berries and licorice.  Other natural flavors and sweetening are added. The origin of the name Sambuca is believed to be Arabian, likely an Italian version of Zammut, - the anise-based drink that first came to the Italian harbors on ships coming from the Far East centuries ago. Residents of Civitavecchia, a port city near Rome, already produced the anise-based liqueur and perhaps renamed it \"Sambuca\" for trading convenience;  Civitavecchians still produce it in large quantities today. While popular in mixed drinks, the common and traditional manner of comsumption is straight, with coffee beans -- two or more depending on the locale. There are a number of respected sambuca brands on the Italian market. These include Sambuca Borghetti and Sambuca Ramazzotti.  With 87% global market share, Sambuca Molinari is the overall market leader, though Sambuca Romano is the most popular in the United States.",

After distillation Strega is aged in ash barrels over a period of time to ensure a perfect blending of aromas. It's 80 proof. Strega is \"witch\" in Italian because according the old legend that places near the city of Benevento as the former seat of witches\u2019 rites.

Formerly a generic spirit like vodka itself, the name rights to zubrowka are now in the hands of one company which had long produced one of the more acclaimed brands of it. Because the bison grass in traditional zubrowka contains coumarin, (an anticoagulant) it was made illegal to import it into the U.S. in 1978. In the late 1990s, one brand with artificial flavoring was produced to fill the void in the face of increasing interest in the spirit. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, which administers American alcohol laws, recently relaxed these restrictions somewhat and the classic brand of zubrowka, Polmos Bialystok, responded with a modified strain of bison grass with lower coumarin levels for the American market. The flavor is virtually indistiguishable from the original, though the color (pale yellow green) is a bit overly-pronounced suggesting some artificial manipulation of the hue.",

Thick, transluscent and straw-colored, it has a subtle sweet/tart/spicy character. There is some question as to when it was created - some sources suggesting as long ago as the 1700s, others pinpointing it in the 1890s or 1930s. \r\n\r\nTwo companies have asserted themselves to be successors to the inventor of falernum. Velvet Falernum, produced by R.L. Seale, Ltd. said to have been invented by John D. Taylor in 1890, and Stansfeld-Scott, Inc., successors to A.V. Stansfeld in said to have been invented by A.V. Stansfeld in 1935. A Bajan brand, Stansfeld Falernum is no longer produced. No independent corroboration has yet been established for either claim. The Velvet Falernum bottle shows a depiction of a gold medal said to have been won in 1923 at a Bajan agricultural exhibition. There too, the depiction is generic and no specific information has been presented regarding the exhibition. Even its general citation is vague. That said, the 45 year earlier claim is persuasive.\r\n\r\nOur research has turned up no written reference previous to the 1930s. While the product may be proprietary insofar as ownership of the Falernum name in certain geographic regions is concerned, multiple companies produce it in its native Barbados, Bermuda, and in the United States. Examples are John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum (Barbados,) Hanschell Innis Falernum (Barbados,) Gosling's Falernum (Bermuda,) Da Vinci Caribbean Falernum (United States,) and Fee Brothers West Indies Style Falernum (United States.)",

Drink recipes may require adjustment based on the proportions chosen, but below are instructions for making the latter which suits drinks seen in Mixology.Recipes:\r\n\r\nFill a bottle halfway with granulated sugar and halfway with filtered water. Cap the bottle and shake it vigorously for several seconds. Set it down for several minutes to allow it to settle, then shake it some more. In time, all of the sugar will have dissolved in the\r\nwater creating a 1:1 simple syrup. As indicated above, proportions may be adjusted to make stronger, thicker syrup, though the more sugar used, the longer dissolution will take. Using \"superfine\" granulated sugar (*not confectioners or powdered sugar*) speeds dilution.\r\n\r\nThe entire process may be accelerated by stirring the sugar and water (at whatever proportional balance is chosen) at a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Care should be taken to regulate the heat as anything over a simmer may create a frothy scum that requires removal.\r\n\r\nFinally, it can be useful to stir in a small quantity of neutral grain spirits (or vodka) as a preservative if long storage is planned.",

Historically, rye was produced mostly in Pennsylvania and aged in warehouses along the Monongahela River, though currently it is made along side the more popular Bourbon in the places Bourbon is produced.\r\n\"Straight rye whiskey\" in the United States means whiskey produced from a mash of at least 51% rye grains, distilled below 160 proof, aged at least two years in new, charred oak barrels, and diluted with nothing other than water.",

Grain alcohol is rarely used in cocktails of any quality, though it has been used in some bottled or machine-dispensed mixed drinks - mainly in tropical or quazi-tropical tourist areas. It is remembered with some chagrin, in certain quarters, as the classic component of 'garbage can punch', but its main use, of cocktail interest, is as the spirit base of some liqueurs and the secondary spirit base of blended whiskies.

George Dickel, chose long ago to spell his like Scotch whisky does, sans \"e\". Dickel's company produced whiskey in Tennessee until it became a \"dry\" state in 1910, and in Kentucky until Prohibition (at the Stitzel distillery #17.) After Prohibition, Stitzel-Weller continued the brand as a Bourbon. Schenley bought name rights from Dickel's successors in the early 1950s and in 1958 began the process of moving the operation back to Tennessee to compete with the hugely successful Jack Daniels. Schenley is now owned by Diageo, and George Dickel #12 is the highest proof Tennessee whiskey made today.",

It is produced by the infusion of 32 herbs macerated in alcohol (including rosemary, thyme and sage) and then added to a mixture of 5 different types of wine. The drink is ruby-colored and has a sweet-sour flavor with notes of citrus and vanilla. Its alcohol content is 17% and is recommended for consumption as an aperitif, served plain with a slice of orange. It is sometimes used as an ingredient in a Negroni cocktail, as a substitute for Vermouth.",
